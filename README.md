# The Longchecker model
Code and model checkpoints for the LongChecker model for scientific claim verification, described in the arXiv preprint [LongChecker: Improving scientific claim verification by modeling full-abstract context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01640).

I'll have this repo populated by the end of December, including downloadable model checkpoints. If you need it sooner, email me and I'll help you get started: `dwadden@cs.washington.edu`.


## Setup

We recommend setting up a Conda environment:
```
conda create --name longchecker python=3.8 conda-build
```

Then, install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
